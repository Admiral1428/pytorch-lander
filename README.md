Inspired by *Lunar Lander (1979)*, the project challenges players to guide a descending rocket safely onto a landing pad across procedurally generated terrain. Beyond manual play, the simulation will support autonomous control via PyTorch, showcasing reinforcement learning and AI-driven decision-making.

**Key features / objectives:**
- Procedural terrain generation with reproducible random seeds
- Physics-based rocket model with 3 degrees of freedom (Z-rotation, X-Y translation)
- Robust collision detection for terrain impact and successful landing validation
- Dual control modes: player inputs or PyTorch-trained AI agents
- Modular code design

This project highlights skills in game development, physics simulation, reproducibility, and AI/ML integration — designed both as a playable experience and a technical showcase.
